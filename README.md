# Digital Twin Wheel subsystem
Organisation: MaRS Rover Students club

🔹 Project Title

Beginner-Level Digital Twin for a Student Rover (Wheel Subsystem)

🔹 Project Overview

Short and honest:

This project explores how a beginner-level digital twin can be built for a student rover using limited real-world data.
The initial focus is on the wheel subsystem, with the goal of evolving from a structured simulator to a data-informed digital twin.

🔹 Why This Project Exists

This is where you stand out:

Many student robotics teams lack the sensors and infrastructure required for full-scale digital twins.
This project aims to create a scalable framework that works even with partial or simulated data and can grow as better instrumentation is added.

🔹 Current Status

Be transparent:
> Status: Early-stage
> System definition completed
> Asset Information Model (AIM) drafted
> Data availability identified
> Initial energy-model planning in progress

🔹 Asset Focus (v1)

**Subsystem: Rover Wheel**
> Drive motor
> Wheel geometry
> Battery interaction
> Operational states

🔹 Data Reality

This builds trust:
**Available Data:**
> Battery voltage logs
> Motor runtime
> Operational states

**Planned / Ideal Data:**
> Current sensing
> Torque estimation
> IMU & vibration

🔹 Roadmap (High-Level)

**Simple bullets:**
> Define wheel asset & AIM
> Build basic energy model
> Create telemetry visualizations
> Introduce simple optimization insights
> Scale to additional subsystems

🔹 Tech Stack (Tentative)

**You can keep this flexible:**
> Python (data analysis & modeling)
> CSV / JSON logs
> Matplotlib / Plotly (visualization)
